Its funny, I was thinking maybe an R&amp;B artist was gonna jump on that beat.</p>\n\n<p>He had the beat, he went in on it, and he sent it back to me. I did a little bit of post-production. On his end, he had his people touch up things on the record, vocally and instrumentally. That\u2019s one thing that\u2019s really important, getting that post-production done because a lot of times producers just wanna send out beats and hope that the record\u2019s just gonna make itself. But it takes more than that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>MixedByAli:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>That song was actually fun to mix. Me and Dr. Dre mixed that one. The beat is real open so you can kind of do whatever you want to it, as far as messing with the vocals. So I was just playing with some delays, some reverbs, tweak it out make it sound real eerie.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>On the extended version, the production switches into soft synths and then building up with the drums hitting harder in an almost boom bap style with Kendrick rapping until the outro skit.</p>"}

He is spiritual, accepting and thoughtful, but he also comes from a city of violence, drugs, crime, etc. Kendrick is an incredibly empathic person; he sees things from all points of view and thus does not fall into any specific classification but rather covers the entire spectrum of humanity. Because of his debilitating empathy, there is a slight distance between himself and his peers. He lives in his own kind of world, observing the behavior and the nature of everything and everyone around him and contemplating it to himself. He is sincere and stable and his ultimate quest is to spread peace.</p>\n\n<p>However, a common tendency for people of this personality-type is to shy away from complex, inexplicable situations where no fair and amicable solution is apparent. When such scenarios occur they may try to retreat into their metaphysical bubble and escape the paradoxical anxieties of life. This is exactly what Kendrick demonstrates in this song (either consciously or subconsciously), and the phrase \u201cBitch Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u201d is a solemn declaration of his desire to attain peace when things cannot be resolved easily.</p>"}

They may be <em>killing your vibe</em> and not allowing you to see things as they are.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://images.rapgenius.com/e40c59fd757a2cff617c678038a6232d.300x189x1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\" data-animated=\"false\"></p>\n\n<p>\u201cHanging/\"blind\u201d and \u201cpain/pane is also a <strong>play on words</strong>, since blinds hang in a window.

The problem with this philosophy is that it ignores people\u2019s cultures and history. This is a problem because of long history of colonization and white supremacy that has ruled over the United States.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, how can you understand Kendrick Lamar\u2019s story if you cannot see who he is, where he comes from, and his history as a Black man living in Compton. If you don\u2019t see race than you don\u2019t see Black. If you don\u2019t see Black, then you don\u2019t see Kendrick. How can he tell his story, when you are blind to who he is and where he comes from?</p>\n\n<p>It can also be understood this way: How can Kendrick make music of substance when most of the music being made has none and how will his audience understand his music when they have become used to music with no substance?</p>"}

Did I put enough work in?", "annotation": "<p>Kendrick explains that this is the way he raps because of his experiences.

Was he worth it? Did he put enough work to be recognized?</p>\n\n<p>Other methodologies for the explanation include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Kendrick is asking someone, possibly God, if this song was enough to pay off the sins he\u2019s committed that he talked about earlier in the verse.</p></li>\n<li><p>He might be realizing that you cannot actually pay off debts (you can\u2019t change the past), but you can change other people\u2019s present moments (if they come to their own insightful revealations) which could, in effect, change their pasts when they get to the future.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>In the first verse you have someone that wants their story to be told by Kendrick. In the second verse you have someone that\u2019s upset with Kendrick for telling their sister\u2019s story on Section.80 and doesn\u2019t want him to talk about them anymore. So when he asks whether or not if he\u2019s worth it, he\u2019s asking if he\u2019s worth being wrote about in a song as well. Which basically means that him rapping about them isn\u2019t him trying to be disrespectful. In fact it\u2019s the complete opposite because he\u2019s questioning whether or not if he\u2019s worthy of the same honor. Kendrick must hold writing a song about someone very high, because he hopes that one day someone will do the same to him and tell his story.</p>\n\n<p>This is also a play on the gang life and the process of moving up in the ranks.
